Java Snake Game

In this part of the Java games, I have create a Java Snake game. Source code can be found at the my Github EAT-GROW---Snake-Game repository.

It is an older classic video game. In this game the player controls a snake. The objective is to eat as many as possible. Each time the snake eats its body grows. 
The snake must avoid its own body. 

The size of each of the joints of a snake is 10 px. The snake is controlled with the direction keys.
